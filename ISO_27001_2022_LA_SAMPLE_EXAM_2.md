## Section 4

**This section consists of three scenarios for which Non-conformity reports (NCR's) may or may not be needed to be completed. (Each question is worth 10 marks.). Please read general instructions regarding section 4.**

### 4.1 Incident 1:

During a Stage 2 audit, you are reviewing the organization's backup procedures. The IT Manager explains that they perform daily backups of all critical systems and data. When you ask to see the backup restoration test records, the IT Manager states: "We haven't actually tested the restoration process yet because we just implemented this backup system 6 months ago, and we haven't had any incidents requiring restoration. However, the backup software vendor assured us that the restoration process works perfectly, and we have all the backup files stored properly."

You verify that:
- Backup logs show successful daily backups
- Backup media is stored in a secure location
- No restoration tests have been performed in the last 6 months
- The organization's own procedure states that backup restoration tests should be conducted quarterly

### 4.2 Incident 2:

During an audit of the Change Management process, you review the change request logs and notice that in the last month, 15 changes were made to the production environment. You randomly select 5 changes to review in detail:

- Changes 1, 2, and 3: Complete documentation including risk assessment, approval, implementation plan, and post-implementation review
- Change 4: Urgent security patch applied on weekend - documented after implementation with retrospective approval from IT Director, includes justification for emergency procedure
- Change 5: Database configuration change made by Senior DBA - Change request shows: "Emergency performance issue - implemented immediately" - No formal risk assessment documented, no formal approval before implementation, but verbal approval mentioned in notes

When questioned about Change 5, the Senior DBA states: "The database was running very slowly and affecting customer transactions. I had to fix it immediately. I called the IT Director and got verbal approval. I documented everything after fixing the issue."

The organization's Change Management procedure states: "All changes must be formally assessed, approved, and documented before implementation. Emergency changes may bypass the formal process but must be documented within 24 hours and reviewed by the Change Advisory Board within 48 hours."

You verify:
- Change 5 was documented 12 hours after implementation
- No Change Advisory Board review has occurred (it has been 5 days)
- The IT Director confirms giving verbal approval
- The emergency was genuine (customer impact was occurring)

### 4.3 Incident 3:

During an audit of the organization's Remote Access controls, you observe that employees are required to use VPN to access the company network from external locations. The Information Security Policy states: "All remote access must use multi-factor authentication (MFA) and encrypted VPN connections."

During your audit, you:
1. Interview the Network Administrator who confirms VPN is mandatory for remote access
2. Observe 3 employees working remotely using VPN connections
3. Review VPN logs showing consistent remote access usage
4. Check the VPN configuration and confirm it requires both password and one-time code (MFA)

However, when reviewing access logs for the application servers, you notice that the CEO has direct access to certain sensitive applications via the internet without going through VPN. When questioned, the IT Manager explains: "The CEO travels frequently internationally and sometimes has connectivity issues with VPN from certain countries. To ensure business continuity, we provided him with direct HTTPS access to critical applications. These connections are still encrypted using TLS 1.3, and he uses a strong password. Only the CEO has this exception."

You verify:
- CEO has accessed applications directly (bypassing VPN) 23 times in the last 2 months
- Connections use HTTPS with strong encryption
- CEO uses only password authentication (no MFA for direct access)
- No documented risk assessment for this exception
- No formal approval for deviation from the Information Security Policy
- CEO is not aware this is an exception to policy
