# ISO 27001 Auditor Risk Assessment and Treatment: Real Scenario

## Introduction  
In this document, we will explore a detailed real-world example of how an auditor conducts a risk assessment and risk treatment within an Information Security Management System (ISMS) audit as per ISO 27001 standards. The example will walk through each step of the process, provide practical examples, and include audit checklists where relevant.

## Step 1: Planning the Risk Assessment  
Before diving into the assessment, the auditor needs to establish the context of the audit. This includes defining:  
- **Scope of the audit**: Identify the boundaries of the ISMS.  
- **Objectives**: Understand what the organization aims to achieve through the ISMS implementation and audit.  

### Example:  
An organization has set a goal to protect customer data and ensure compliance with GDPR.  

## Step 2: Identifying Risks  
The auditor conducts interviews, reviews documentation, and engages in observation to identify potential risks related to information security.

### Practical Example:  
- **Interviews**: Discuss security practices with IT staff.  
- **Documentation**: Review security policies and incident reports.  
- **Observation**: Inspect physical security controls in the data center.  

## Step 3: Assessing Risks  
For each identified risk, the auditor must assess the likelihood and impact to prioritize them accordingly.

### Risk Assessment Formula:  
**Risk = Likelihood x Impact**  

#### Practical Example:  
- Risk: Unauthorized access to sensitive data  
- Likelihood: High (4)  
- Impact: Severe (5)  
- Overall Risk Rating: 20 (High)

## Step 4: Risk Treatment  
The auditor and the organization must decide how to treat each identified risk.  
Treatment options include:
- **Accepting** the risk  
- **Mitigating** the risk  
- **Transferring** the risk  
- **Avoiding** the risk  

### Practical Example:  
For the risk of unauthorized access, the organization may choose to mitigate by implementing two-factor authentication.

## Step 5: Developing an Action Plan  
An action plan should be created, detailing how to treat each risk, responsible parties, and deadlines.

### Audit Checklist:  
- [ ] Action items identified  
- [ ] Responsible persons assigned  
- [ ] Deadlines established  

## Conclusion  
The above steps provide a structured approach for auditors conducting risk assessments and treatments in an ISMS audit. It is essential to document all findings and actions taken to ensure continuous improvement within the ISMS framework.
