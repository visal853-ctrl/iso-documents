### 3.2 Continual improvement in ISO 27001:2022 ISMS (10 marks)

**Marking Criteria:**
- Explanation of continual improvement concept (2 marks)
- Description of implementation approach (3 marks)
- Evidence auditor should look for (3 marks)
- Connection to PDCA cycle (2 marks)

**Model Answer:**

**Continual Improvement in ISO 27001:2022 ISMS**

**Concept (2 marks):**
Continual improvement is a fundamental principle of ISO 27001:2022, explicitly required in Clause 10.1. It means the organization must continuously enhance the suitability, adequacy, and effectiveness of the ISMS. This is not a one-time activity but an ongoing commitment to make incremental or breakthrough improvements in information security performance, risk management, and ISMS processes.

**Implementation Approach (3 marks):**

Organizations should implement continual improvement through:

1. **Monitoring and Measurement** - Establish metrics and KPIs to measure ISMS performance (Clause 9.1)
2. **Internal Audits** - Regular audits to identify improvement opportunities (Clause 9.2)
3. **Management Review** - Top management reviews ISMS performance and identifies improvements (Clause 9.3)
4. **Corrective Actions** - When nonconformities occur, implement corrective actions (Clause 10.1)
5. **Preventive Approach** - Proactively identify risks and opportunities for improvement (Clause 6.1)
6. **Learning from Incidents** - Analyze security incidents to improve controls (Clause 8.2, 8.3)

**Evidence Auditor Should Look For (3 marks):**

An auditor should verify:

1. **Documented Improvements** - Records of changes made to improve the ISMS (policies, procedures, controls)
2. **Corrective Action Records** - Evidence of nonconformities identified and corrected, with root cause analysis
3. **Management Review Minutes** - Documentation showing management identifies and approves improvement initiatives
4. **Audit Findings Trends** - Analysis of audit findings over time showing reduction in issues
5. **Metrics and KPIs** - Security metrics tracked over time showing improvement trends
6. **Incident Analysis** - Evidence that lessons learned from incidents are implemented
7. **Control Effectiveness Reviews** - Regular reviews of whether controls are achieving intended results
8. **Staff Feedback** - Mechanisms for employees to suggest improvements (suggestion systems)

**PDCA Cycle Connection (2 marks):**

The continual improvement requirement is intrinsically linked to the Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) cycle:

- **PLAN** (Clauses 4-6): Establish ISMS scope, risk assessment, objectives, and improvement plans
- **DO** (Clauses 7-8): Implement controls, resources, awareness, operations
- **CHECK** (Clause 9): Monitor, measure, audit, and review ISMS performance
- **ACT** (Clause 10): Take corrective actions and continually improve

The PDCA cycle ensures that improvement is systematic. The "Check" phase identifies what needs improvement, and the "Act" phase implements improvements, which then become inputs to the next "Plan" phase, creating a continuous cycle of enhancement.

ISO 27001:2022 explicitly requires organizations to "continually improve the suitability, adequacy and effectiveness of the ISMS" (Clause 10.1), making this cycle mandatory rather than optional.

## Section 4 - Scenario Analysis (30 Marks Total)

### 4.1 Incident 1 - Backup Restoration Testing (10 marks)

**Expected Answer: NON-CONFORMITY**

**Marking Distribution:**
- Correct identification (NC vs Observation): 2 marks
- Category (Major vs Minor): 2 marks
- Clause/Control identification: 2 marks
- Non-conformity description: 4 marks

**Answer:**

**This IS a Non-Conformity - MINOR**

**Clause/Control No:** ISO 27001:2022 Clause 8.13 (Information Backup) / Annex A Control 8.13

**Category:** **Minor Non-Conformity**

**Reasoning for Minor (not Major):**
- Backups are being performed regularly (system exists and is operational)
- Backup logs show successful execution
- Storage is secure
- However, effectiveness cannot be confirmed without testing
- This is a gap in verification/validation, not a complete absence of the control

**Non-Conformity Details:**

The organization has failed to test backup restoration procedures as required by their own procedure and ISO 27001:2022 Control 8.13, which states "Regular testing of backup information shall be undertaken to ensure it can be relied upon for use."

**Objective Evidence:**
- Organization's procedure requires quarterly restoration tests
- No restoration tests conducted in 6 months since implementation
- IT Manager confirmed testing has not occurred
- Reliance solely on vendor assurance without verification

**Why this is Non-Conformity:**
The organization cannot demonstrate that backups are restorable and effective. ISO 27001 requires verification that backup information can be restored. Having backups without testing restoration is insufficient - the organization cannot confirm business continuity capability in case of data loss incident.

**What would you do next if candidate says "Observation":**
This should NOT be an observation because:
- There is clear objective evidence (no test records, admission by IT Manager)
- It violates the organization's own documented procedure
- It violates ISO 27001:2022 Control 8.13 requirements
- The 6-month period without testing is significant

**Alternative acceptable answer:** Some auditors might categorize this as MAJOR if they argue:
- 6 months is substantial time
- Risk to business continuity is high if backups fail during actual incident
- However, MINOR is more appropriate as the backup system exists and operates

### 4.2 Incident 2 - Change Management Process (10 marks)

**Expected Answer: NON-CONFORMITY**

**Marking Distribution:**
- Correct identification (NC vs Observation): 2 marks
- Category (Major vs Minor): 2 marks
- Clause/Control identification: 2 marks
- Non-conformity description: 4 marks

**Answer:**

**This IS a Non-Conformity - MINOR**

**Clause/Control No:** ISO 27001:2022 Annex A Control 8.32 (Change Management)

**Category:** **Minor Non-Conformity**

**Reasoning for Minor:**
- Changes 1, 2, 3 show the system generally works effectively (3 out of 5 compliant)
- Change 4 demonstrates emergency procedure exists and was followed correctly
- Change 5 shows partial compliance (documented within 24 hours) but missing CAB review
- This is an isolated incident, not systemic failure
- The change itself was legitimate emergency and approved (verbally)

**Non-Conformity Details:**

The organization failed to fully implement their documented Change Management procedure for Change 5, specifically failing to conduct Change Advisory Board (CAB) review within 48 hours as required.

**Objective Evidence:**
- Change 5 was documented after implementation (compliant - within 24 hours)
- Verbal approval was obtained (shows some control)
- However, no CAB review conducted after 5 days (non-compliant with procedure)
- Organization's own procedure requires CAB review within 48 hours for emergency changes

**Why this is Non-Conformity:**
ISO 27001:2022 Control 8.32 requires changes to be controlled through a change management process. The organization has a documented procedure that includes CAB review for emergency changes, but they failed to follow it completely. The missing CAB review means the emergency change was not properly reviewed and validated, which could lead to security risks or problems not being identified.

**Why Minor (not Major or Observation):**
- The overall change management system is operational and mostly effective
- This is one instance out of five changes reviewed (80% compliance rate)
- The change was urgent and genuine, with verbal approval
- Documentation occurred timely
- However, the procedure was not fully followed (missing CAB review)
- Not major because it's an isolated case, not systemic breakdown

**What would you do next:**
Request evidence of CAB review completion for Change 5, and recommend the organization ensure all emergency changes go through the full procedure, including CAB review within specified timeframes. Also recommend reminder training for staff on emergency change procedures.

### 4.3 Incident 3 - Remote Access Exception (10 marks)

**Expected Answer: NON-CONFORMITY**

**Marking Distribution:**
- Correct identification (NC vs Observation): 2 marks
- Category (Major vs Minor): 2 marks
- Clause/Control identification: 2 marks
- Non-conformity description: 4 marks

**Answer:**

**This IS a Non-Conformity - MAJOR**

**Clause/Control No:** ISO 27001:2022 Annex A Controls 5.18 (Access Rights), 6.7 (Remote Working), 8.5 (Secure Authentication), and Clause 5.2 (Policy)

**Category:** **MAJOR Non-Conformity**

**Reasoning for Major:**
- Bypasses a critical security control (MFA)
- Affects a high-risk area (remote access to sensitive applications)
- Involves a high-privileged user (CEO)
- No risk assessment conducted
- No formal approval or documented exception
- Violates documented Information Security Policy
- CEO is unaware this violates policy (lack of awareness at top level)
- This represents a significant security risk

**Non-Conformity Details:**

The organization has implemented a critical security exception that bypasses the Information Security Policy requirement for multi-factor authentication (MFA) on remote access, without conducting a risk assessment, obtaining formal approval, or documenting the exception. This affects the CEO's access to sensitive applications.

**Objective Evidence:**
1. Information Security Policy states: "All remote access must use multi-factor authentication (MFA)"
2. CEO has bypassed VPN (which has MFA) 23 times in 2 months
3. CEO uses only password authentication (no MFA) for direct access
4. No documented risk assessment for this configuration
5. No formal approval for policy deviation
6. CEO is unaware this is an exception to policy
7. IT Manager implemented this informally without proper process

**Why this is Major Non-Conformity:**

This represents a MAJOR non-conformity for multiple serious reasons:

1. **Control Bypass:** Critical security control (MFA) is bypassed, creating significant security vulnerability
2. **High Risk:** CEO has access to sensitive applications without adequate authentication
3. **Policy Violation:** Direct violation of documented Information Security Policy
4. **No Risk Management:** No risk assessment conducted (violates Clause 6.1)
5. **No Management Approval:** No formal authorization for policy exception (violates Clause 5.2)
6. **Lack of Awareness:** CEO unaware of deviation, indicating poor information security culture at leadership level
7. **Informal Process:** Security exception implemented informally by IT Manager
8. **Affects Leadership:** Involves CEO, who should be demonstrating commitment to policy (Clause 5.1)

**Impact:**
- CEO account is vulnerable to credential theft (password-only)
- If CEO credentials are compromised, attacker has direct access to sensitive applications
- Bypassing VPN means no network-level monitoring/logging
- Sets poor example for information security culture

**Why NOT Minor:**
This cannot be minor because:
- It involves critical control (MFA) for high-risk access (remote)
- It affects sensitive applications
- There is no formal exception management process followed
- The risk is significant and unassessed
- Multiple ISO 27001 requirements are violated simultaneously

**Corrective Action Required:**
1. Immediate: Implement MFA for CEO's direct access OR require CEO to use VPN
2. Conduct formal risk assessment for CEO's remote access needs
3. If exception is justified, document with formal risk assessment and top management approval
4. Implement formal exception management process
5. Review all other potential informal exceptions
6. Ensure CEO and all leadership understand and follow security policies

## General Grading Notes

**Section 4 Scenarios - Common Mistakes:**

1. **Confusing Major vs Minor:**
   - **Major NC:** Complete absence of control, systemic failure, high security risk, multiple violations
   - **Minor NC:** Control exists but not fully effective, isolated incident, documentation gap, procedural non-compliance

2. **Insufficient Detail in NCR:**
   - Must include specific objective evidence
   - Must cite exact clause/control numbers
   - Must explain why it's a non-conformity
   - Must justify major vs minor categorization

3. **Being too lenient:**
   - "Observation" should be used when there's insufficient evidence or potential for future issue
   - If there's clear evidence of non-compliance with requirements, it should be an NCR

**TÜV SÜD Specific Guidance:**
- Always reference specific ISO 27001:2022 clauses and Annex A controls
- Consider business impact and information security risk when categorizing
- Document objective evidence clearly
- Apply risk-based thinking to audit findings
- Consider context of the organization when determining severity
